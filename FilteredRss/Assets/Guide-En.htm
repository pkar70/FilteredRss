<h1 class="style2">Filtered RSS - reader with filtering</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This app is RSS reader, but different than others - it is written to fulfill 
another requirements. Maybe you would find it appropriate also?</p>
<p>Main purpose of this reader is:</p>
<ul>
				<li>filtering RSS posts;</li>
				<li>notifying about selected RSS posts;</li>
				<li> show whole post without going to web server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most RSS readers show only post headers, and after clicking on it - whole 
post, but post retrieved from external web server. If this server requires 
authorization, you get logon screen, not post info. And you already have post 
info (from RSS feed). So, this reader, after clicking on post header in list, 
shows you whole description of this post from RSS feed. If you want to get even 
more information, you can click again, and your default web browser would be 
directed to web server.</p>
<p class="style3">FilteredRSS, as name implies, allows you to filter posts - you can enter 
blacklist, i.e. list of phrases that if found in post, cause post to be ignored. 
Unless would be found phrase from whitelist in same post. Patterns could be 
prefixed with &quot;T:&quot;, meaning it is checked only in post title (not in whole 
post&#39;s text), or with &quot;D:&quot; meaning test will be performed only in description of 
post, or &quot;F:&quot;, meaning onnly feed name would be tested. It means than if there is no prefix, pattern would be tested in whole post 
(title, description, and any other fields, even GUID or image link.</p>
<p class="style3">Every phrase in 
blacklist that could be a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference">regular expression</a> 
is treated as such - but for most cases, you can simply enter any fragment of 
post as phrase. If you want to test regular expression, you can invoke special &quot;regexp 
tester&quot; page. There your regular expression would be tested against up to three 
phrases.</p>
<p>Whitelist phrases could also make app sending you toast notification; there 
is also special phrase, star (*) - it means that toast should be shown for every 
post that is not filtered out by blacklist. </p>
<p>Three settings (list of feeds, blacklist, whitelist) could be stored locally 
on device, or in the cloud. When you send them to cloud, and install app on 
another device, you will get configured app. But local settings are more 
important than from cloud, i.e. if you edit settings and save them locally, 
cloud data would be ignored.</p>
<p>Warning: most RSS readers shows posts sorted by feed, this reader has no such 
functionality.</p>
<p>Try this app and be happy :)</p>
